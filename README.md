# React Guitar Lessons Site

This is a simple guitar lessons website created with react. It has good
transitions and animations. It's just a frontend project that I was inspired to
make

You can preview it [here](https://guitar-lessons-page.vercel.app/)

> **Note:** I have actually ran the build command and I have put the data in a
> folder called `doc`

## Editing

Incase you'll like to edit the data, you can do the following

```sh
npm install
# Run the above command to install all the required packages and also
npm start
# This will start off the react-app in your localhost
```

Also, If you would like to run your own build, you can still move on to run

`npm run build`
